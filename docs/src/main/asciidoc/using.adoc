= Using Datasource Micrometer

include::_attributes.adoc[]

This section goes into more detail about how you should use {project-full-name}.

[[using-types-of-observation]]
== Types of Observations

The {project-full-name} creates Connection, Query, Generated Keys(from `v1.1`), and ResultSet observations.

The Connection observation represents the database connection operations. It is the base observation, as any database access requires a connection.
The Query observation provides query execution details, such as execution time, SQL query, bind parameters, etc.
The Generated Keys observation records generated keys when auto-generated keys feature is used for the insert statements.
The ResultSet observation shows how the operations fetched the data from the query result, including the number of retrieved rows.

To configure these observations, see <<howto.adoc#how-to-add-tracingobservationhandler>>.  +
For Spring Boot, see <<howto.adoc#how-to-choose-what-to-observe>>.


[[using-features]]
== Features

[[using-features-hikaricp-support]]
=== HikariCP Support

`jdbc.datasource.driver` and `jdbc.datasource.pool` tags are available when the target datasource is a `HikariDataSource`.

The `HikariJdbcObservationFilter` provides this feature and this observation filter needs to be registered to the `ObservationRegistry`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
ObservationRegistry registry = ...
registry.observationConfig().observationFilter(new HikariJdbcObservationFilter());
----

It is auto configured in `datasource-micrometer-spring-boot`.

[[using-features-remote-ip-and-port]]
=== Remote IP and Port

For spans, remote IP and port are retrieved from the datasource url.

[[using-features-remote-service-name]]
=== Remote Service Name

The datasource name is used as the remote service name in spans.
The name is specified when creating a proxy datasource by {datasource-proxy}[datasource-proxy].

[source,java,indent=0]
----
DataSource instrumented =
    ProxyDataSourceBuilder.create(dataSource)
        .name("myDS")    // Specify datasource name
        .listener(listener)
        .methodListener(listener)
        .build;
----

For `datasource-micrometer-spring-boot`, the datasource name is resolved by looking the catalog name at start up (or the connection pool name for Hikari, then fallback to its beanname) by default.

To specify a custom datasource name, see <<howto.adoc#how-to-customize-the-proxydatasource-name>> and <<howto.adoc#how-to-customize-the-proxydatasource-creation>> section.

[[using-features-application-events]]
=== Application Events
Since version `1.1`, `datasource-micrometer-spring-boot` can publish Spring's application events for query executions and method invocations on proxied JDBC classes.
This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the property `jdbc.event.enabled=true`.
When enabled, it publishes events - `JdbcQueryExecutionEvent` and `JdbcMethodExecutionEvenet`.

[[using-limitations]]
== Limitations
[[using-limitations-open-session-in-view]]
=== Open Session In View
Unfortunately, Open Session In View (OSIV) is not supported.
This is because OSIV delays closing the database connection until the HTTP response is sent.

Observation scope orders without OSIV:

. Open HTTP request observation scope
. Open DB connection observation scope
. (Other observation scopes)
. Close DB connection observation scope
. Close HTTP request observation scope

However, with OSIV enabled, the DB connection closing is delayed, leading to the following order:

. Open HTTP request observation scope
. Open DB connection observation scope
. (Other observation scopes)
. *(SWAPPED)* Close HTTP request observation scope
. *(SWAPPED)* Close DB connection observation scope

Since observation scopes must be closed in the reverse order of their creation, this swapped ordering causes observation leaks.

To disable OSIV, set `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false`.
